I read *Hooked* by Nir Eyal. And I won't be becoming a drug dealer.

---

The main goal of Hooked is to get your users *addicted* to your product. Or, if you have those pesky things called *morals*, instead of addiction choose *passionate about*, *really into*, or *close to the users' heart and mind*.

In all seriousness, this book contains fundamental structures to building engaging products, with the focus solely on the *psychology* of the user in relation to the product.

I'm at the start of my product building career, so this book comes at a good time. It taught me to ask first, before writing any code, who is my intended user base? What pain do they have? What does my product do to relieve said pain? What will keep them using my product? Get a clear view of the psychological landscape first.

With my first product [Trakible](https://www.trakible.com/), I can see clearly in retrospect many things that could be improved on. Sign up flows, notifications, ways to reward the user, and many more. I don't beat myself up about this though, as Trakible is my first real product, and I hadn't read this book yet! I really look forward to building my next app using what I learned from Hooked (in a responsible way of course!).

Recently I read the ubiquitously known book *Atomic Habits by James Clear*. I see Hooked and Atomic Habits as *two sides of the same habits coin*. Atomic Habits is all about changing your own habits by *yourself*. Hooked is about changing habits for *other people* - your users. I guess the important lesson here *treat your users as you would yourself* (with respect, hopefully!). Nir talks about this in the "morality of manipulation" section.

I'm no fan of social media apps, and am fortunate enough to be able to see past the blatant attempts of endless notifications, tricking into sharing my contact book on sign up flows, rage baiting content, et cetera. I've worked hard to not get addicted to apps, and be truthful about what my current electronic dependencies are. This is a privileged position, as a technologist making products and being in the space - I know how the sausage is made.

*That is all to say that I am reaffirming my responsibility to build products that improve peoples' lives, and to do it in a way that is respectful of the user and without addictive methods*. Especially for the people (we all know someone) who are easily deceived and get addicted to *bad app-tors* (sorry). Similar to how Dong Nguyen, author of Flappy Bird, pulled the app after it became a widely addictive past-time, I would feel like an asshole if the product I created had negative effects on its users.

I recommend Hooked to new engineers who don't yet have their moral compass solidified for how/what/where they will spend their career. And also for anyone struggling with an addiction to some app or technology, this book is a good peek behind the curtain.
